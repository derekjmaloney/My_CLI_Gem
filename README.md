# MyCLIGem

  Free_NYC is a Gem I created in order to help me stay active and get the most out of the various free events that NYC has to offer.  Run My_CLI_Gem from the bin folder to get started.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'My_CLI_Gem'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install Free_NYC_Today

## Usage

 Execute ./bin/My_CLI_Gem in your terminal to begin.  Instructions once program is running are self explanatory :)

## Development


To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
