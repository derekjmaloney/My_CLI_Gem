# Free_NYC_Today

  Free_NYC_Today is a Gem I created in order to help me stay active and get the most out of the various free events that NYC has to offer.  Run My_CLI_Gem from the bin folder to get started.

## Installation

You can install this gem via gem install Free_NYC_Today. The Free_NYC_Today CLI will be installed and you can run Free_NYC_Today to get the command line to begin the program.

## Usage

 Execute ./bin/Free_NYC_Today in your terminal to begin.  Instructions once program is running are self explanatory :)

## Development


To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
