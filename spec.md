# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application
- [x] Pull data from an external source
      I pulled data from Timeout.com, specifically from the Free Things To Do in NYC Today page (https://www.timeout.com/newyork/things-to-do/free-things-to-do-today)
- [x] Implement both list and detail views
      Upon startup, the user is given a list of today's selected events.  He/She can then dive one level deeper--by selecting an event from the list--to receive more information, i.e. Location, Description, and url to learn more info.
